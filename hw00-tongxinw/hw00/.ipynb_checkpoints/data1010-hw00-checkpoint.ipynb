This is partly so that we can review your work in an efficient and uniform way, partly to equip you with new skills for producing documents, and partly to ensure that you don't have to waste time inventing your own system and refining your tooling. We can also help you troubleshoot much more effectively than if folks are using lots of different programs. Rest assured that this process represents a carefully considered tradeoff between quality of output and production efficiency."
