    "Eytan applied gradient descent to the function $f(x) = (x-3)(x-1)(x+2)(x+3)$ starting from $x_0 = -4$, and he found that his algorithm failed to converge because $x_2 = -4$, $x_4 = -4$, and so on. In other words, the iterates alternated between $-4$ and another value. What learning rate did he use?\n",
